            "full_text": "BANK INDONESIA (BI) recently announced the continuation of its burden sharing scheme with the government and has purchased 200 trillion rupiah (US$12bil) worth of government bonds on the primary market as of early September.\n\nThe burden sharing scheme was partly intended to help finance president Prabowo Subianto’s priority programmes that focus on the so-called community economy agenda, such as public housing, food security, small enterprise support and rural cooperatives.\n\nAt first glance, the BI policy seems straightforward. By stepping in as a large buyer, the central bank helps push bond yields lower, which in turn reduces borrowing costs and gives the government more fiscal space to fund its populist programs.\n\nCautious stance\n\nFor policymakers, this looks like a practical solution. Yet, economists view it more cautiously. That is because burden sharing is essentially debt monetisation, or what textbooks call “seigniorage”. Here is how seigniorage works.\n\nWhen the central bank buys government bonds on the primary market, it credits the government’s account with newly created money.\n\nThis expands both government debt and the central bank’s balance sheet. Bajaj and Datt (2020) describe three types of monetisation: direct (buying bonds directly on the primary market), indirect (buying them on the secondary market) and debt write-off.\n\nAlthough the mechanisms vary, the core idea remains the same: money is created to finance government expenditure.\n\nIn practice, debt monetisation is similar to quantitative easing. The crucial difference between the two is that the central bank is allowed to buy only seasoned bonds under quantitative easing, whereas under debt monetisation, it is allowed to buy new government securities as a direct source of financing (Cukierman, 2021).\n\nThis distinction explains why monetisation is often considered taboo.\n\nMany concerns exist on the risks monetisation will pose to macroeconomic stability, notably related to inflation and the exchange rate.\n\nThe practice undermines central bank independence and opens the door to fiscal dominance.\n\nBlurred lines\n\nWith BI now holding around a quarter of all outstanding government bonds, the line between fiscal and monetary policy is blurring.\n\nThis is what economists call fiscal dominance. Under normal circumstances, BI should focus narrowly on its mandate: ensuring price stability, which in practice means maintaining low inflation and a stable rupiah.\n\nUnlike the United States Federal Reserve, which carries the dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment, BI holds no such balancing role.\n\nThere is no urgency for BI to sacrifice its independence for the cost of higher inflation and depreciation.\n\nWith the current high government debt ratio, at around 39% of gross domestic product, the burden sharing scheme merely creates public and investor concerns about Indonesia’s macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability.\n\nThe consequences of this fiscal dominance are already visible. Large-scale liquidity injections put downward pressure on the rupiah, raising the risk of imported inflation and a weaker trade balance.\n\nThis is especially dangerous in Indonesia, where more than 90% of raw materials are imported for the manufacturing industry and capital goods.\n\nAny depreciation of the rupiah translates almost directly into higher domestic prices, hitting low-income households the hardest. At the same time, rising debt ratios leave the economy more vulnerable to shocks and narrow fiscal space in the future.\n\nLost credibility\n\nThe most worrying is the loss of some degree of central bank independence. Credibility will be lost once markets perceive that BI’s policy choices are driven by fiscal needs rather than its legal mandate, and rebuilding credibility is far harder than defending it in the first place.\n\nTo avoid falling into this trap, BI must first and foremost draw clear boundaries around its burden sharing role. Transparency should be the first step.\n\nThe central bank needs to tell markets how much it intends to purchase, over what maturities and for how long, as well as under what conditions it will exit. During the Covid-19 pandemic, policymakers stressed that burden sharing was only a one-off emergency measure. That clear communication reassured investors who feared permanent monetization.\n\nA similar level of clarity is even more necessary today. A single example of an exit strategy, such as tightening banks’ reserve requirements, can also anchor expectations and help reassure markets.\n\nSecond, the central bank must maintain monetary discipline. Bond purchases tend to weaken the rupiah. To anchor market expectations, BI should deploy foreign exchange interventions in a consistent and predictable manner.\n\nWithout careful calibration, burden sharing could accelerate depreciation and drive up imported inflation.\n\nFinally, the central bank must maintain its independence by implementing sound fiscal-monetary coordination. The government must maintain fiscal discipline while BI upholds its mandate for rupiah stability.\n\nAs Alesina and Summers (1993) demonstrated, independent central banks are consistently associated with lower inflation and stronger macroeconomic performance.\n\nThe burden sharing policy should be an instrument to be used only in times of extraordinary crisis or force majeure, such as the pandemic. Indonesia must avoid turning burden sharing into fiscal dependence.\n\nOutside a crisis situation, such a fiscal dominance policy would erode market trust and central bank independence. — The Jakarta Post/ANN\n\nNauli Desdiani is a researcher at the University of Indonesia Institute for Economic and Social Research and a doctoral candidate at the University of Groningen.

Standard & Poor’s (S&P) has raised the country's sovereign credit rating by one notch from ‘B+’ to ‘BB-’ Fidelity Bank chief executive said this was far from the end game but “merely a step towards the achievement we are targeting” – a return to investment grade status with all the rating agencies .",
            "full_text": "By NEIL HARTNELL\n\nTribune Business Editor\n\nnhartnell@tribunemedia.net\n\nThe Bahamas is being urged not to let its upgraded credit rating from Standard & Poor’s “go to your head” even as a prominent businessman hailed the move as “a game changer” and signal the economy has “turned the corner”.\n\nGowon Bowe, Fidelity Bank (Bahamas) chief executive, speaking after Standard & Poor’s (S&P) raised the country’s sovereign credit rating by one notch from ‘B+’ to ‘BB-‘ on the basis of it strengthened economy, told Tribune Business that this was far from the end game but “merely a step towards the achievement we are targeting” – a return to investment grade status with all the rating agencies.\n\nThe Bahamas still remains three notches away from escaping so-called ‘junk’ status with S&P, and Mr Bowe said this nation must remain disciplined, “continue those actions” that sparked this upgrade and “accelerate” the improvements if it is to achieve Prime Minister Philip Davis KC’s ambitions of restoring ‘investment grade’ status by 2028-2029.\n\nHowever, Sir Franklyn Wilson, the Arawak Homes and Sunshine Holdings chairman, described S&P’s assessment of The Bahamas’ improved creditworthiness as “a game changer” and signal that this nation is “bouncing back” from the $1.335bn fiscal deficit it incurred for 2020-2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic’s peak.\n\nAsserting that he was “not being partisan”, he argued that the then-Minnis administration had expanded the fiscal deficit at “too rapid” a pace even though significant public spending was necessary after the Bahamian economy was forced to shutdown almost overnight by the pandemic.\n\nSir Franklyn said the S&P upgrade is a sign of improved investor and international capital markets confidence that The Bahamas is emerging from those struggles, and agreed that the country’s enhanced creditworthiness will improve the Government’s access to financing and ability to borrow at lower costs (reduced interest rates) and better terms.\n\nCredit rating upgrades typically give investors greater confidence that countries are managing their fiscal affairs prudently, which can help attract greater levels of foreign direct investment, while lower borrowing costs help ease the debt servicing burden for Bahamian taxpayers.\n\nS&P, explaining what drove The Bahamas’ credit rating upgrade, cited the upward revision to The Bahamas’ gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2024 by the Bahamas National Statistical Institute (BNSI) to 3.4 percent as well as its strong tourism arrivals performance – especially in the cruise industry.\n\nProviding a further boost by forecasting that Bahamian economic output or GDP growth for 2025 will beat both earlier predictions and its long-run average by coming in at 2.1 percent, S&P said the Government’s energy reforms will be critical to lowering costs for households and companies, improving the ease of doing business and introducing more reliable power supply.\n\n“The Bahamas' GDP grew at a stronger pace of 3.4 percent in 2024, following revised GDP data collection methods from the Bahamas National Statistical Institute, including wider geographic coverage across the Family Islands,” S&P said.\n\n“Further, The Bahamas' tourism sector continued to perform very well, particularly within the cruise segment. Total arrivals in 2024 were 11.2m, compared with 9.6 m the year before and up about 153 percent from 2019. The economy also had support from sustained investments across the Family Islands.\n\n“We expect growth in 2025 will remain above potential at 2.1 percent, accounting for continued buoyancy in tourism despite challenges in key source markets. GDP per capita is estimated at $39,590,” S&P added. “The number of inbound arrivals reached 6.3m in the first half of 2025, compared with 5.7m during the same period in 2024.\n\n“The Bahamas is advancing on its comprehensive energy reforms announced in June 2024, with key partnerships and contracts signed set to support improvements to the country's transmission and distribution infrastructure, as well as diversifying energy sources in favour of solar power and natural gas. These shifts could create important savings and ease the high costs of doing business in the Bahamas over the long-term.”\n\nMr Bowe told Tribune Business that S&P’s action was “absolutely positive news”. He added: “It’s one of moving us up one notch closer to ‘investment grade’. As with all rating assessments, it’s more important to read through the basis for which they made their decision.\n\n“Ultimately, there’s a significant amount of reliance based on the fiscal projections; maybe not a surplus but a reduction in the fiscal deficit and curtailment of expenditure. If we achieve a surplus that’s a bonus. It isn’t one that we must achieve a surplus, but if we get closer to that in the eight to ten months that will bode well and support the upgrade that has taken place.”\n\nMr Bowe acknowledged that energy reform is “high on the agenda” for S&P “from the perspective they are looking to see this isn’t lip service; we are going to see the investments you [the Government] are speaking about and see a reduction in energy costs and improved reliability. That’s a high priority”.\n\nThe Fidelity Bank (Bahamas) chief added that another key focus for S&P, as well as its fellow rating agencies, Moody’s and Fitch, is whether the Government will hit its much-touted 25 percent revenue-to-GDP target as well as wider tax reforms.\n\nExamining the overall impact from S&P’s rating upgrade, which is the first that The Bahamas has enjoyed for almost two decades, Mr Bowe added: “To me, I say let us not get too high on the highs or too low on the lows.\n\n“This one is certainly a positive move. It puts us in non-investment grade with lower risk, and places us in a positive light.” The Bahamas also appears to be tracking Jamaica, albeit one notch behind, with S&P having also raised its fellow Caribbean nation’s credit rating last week.\n\nMr Bowe said Jamaica was more advanced than The Bahamas from the standpoint of having already achieved a Budget surplus and lowered its debt-to-GDP ratio to under 60 percent. This nation’s debt-to-GDP ratio remains in the 70-80 percent range.\n\n“The reason why it’s important to get debt-to-GDP down is because it gives us headroom for hurricanes, it gives us headroom to look at capital development and advancement, it gives us some headroom for future borrowing and asset utilization,” Mr Bowe added.\n\n“It’s important to remain disciplined. There shouldn’t be exaggeration of the upgrade. It’s not taking us from non-investment grade to investment grade. There’s still three notches to go to investment grade.\n\n“It means read the tea leaves for the basis of why they’ve given this assessment, so we manage and ensure these things are carried out and executed so that we can look forward to further upgrades in the ensuing years.”\n\nMr Bowe continued: “In the Bahamian vernacular, the best way to put it is: ‘Don’t let it go your head’. This is not the achievement we want. It’s merely a step to achievement of your target. Don’t get enamoured by a one-notch improvement from non-investment grade to non-investment grade.\n\n“We must continue these positive actions and make sure where possible to accelerate them.” He added that the information upon which S&P based its decision will be available to all other rating agencies as well as multilateral institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which should aid consistency in their assessment of The Bahamas and, potentially, further creditworthiness upgrades.\n\nSir Franklyn, meanwhile, said of S&P’s actions: “It’s a game changer, it’s a game changer. I have just got back from Washington DC, and what is becoming clearer and clearer to me.. I was speaking to some people and what happened to The Bahamas was, and I’m not being partisan here, but what happened here is that the pace at which the Minnis administration increased the national deficit was the problem.\n\n“It happened too quickly. COVID happened, and we have to understand the effects, but the pace of it was too rapid. It was too rapid. I was speaking to a finance man who knows The Bahamas extremely well, and his point was that confidence is building that we are bouncing back from that; that particular period.\n\n“When Minnis ran the deficit up at the pace he did it was too fast. That was too fast. It was too fast. That was the problem. I think it takes time for people to see that we are over that. That’s what I think international agencies are now gaining confidence in. We are over that,” Sir Franklyn added.\n\n“I think this [the S&P upgrade] is really a comment on the fact we have turned the corner from that rapid pace of escalation under Minnis.” Tribune Business calculations show that some $2.896bn was added to The Bahamas’ national debt over the three-year period between 2019-2020 and 2021-2022.\n\nThe Government incurred annual fiscal deficits ranging from $839m during the first of those three fiscal years to $1.335bn in the second and $722m in the latter. However, all were in response to unexpected events – first, the loss, damage and rebuilding caused by Hurricane Dorian and, second, the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "full_text": "The exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider on Monday launched the Betashares Private Capital Cliffwater Private Credit Fund, the first of its kind in Betashares’ newly established private capital division.\n\nThe unlisted fund aims to provide wholesale investors and financial advisers with cost-effective access to a diversified portfolio of senior loans to predominantly US middle-market companies via a fund managed by private markets manager Cliffwater LLC.\n\nAccording to Betashares, the underlying strategy has delivered attractive risk-adjusted returns with a strong degree of capital stability across different market conditions.\n\nUpon launching its private capital arm, Betashares flagged its push into the asset class was a key part of a long-term strategy of building a diversified financial services business. Betashares is building a range of initiatives – including Betashares Direct, superannuation and now Private Assets – beyond its range of ETFs.\n\nIndustry figures have previously cautioned that attempts to package private credit into ETFs risk distorting an illiquid asset class and undermining investor outcomes.\n\nNamely, at the Australian Wealth Management Summit in Sydney last month, Stéphane Blanchoz, BNP Paribas Asset Management’s head of alternative solutions, said: “We have to be careful when we talk about ETFs because we’re turning something illiquid into something liquid, and off we go.\n\n“I’ve seen many initiatives to have a private credit ETF, and we’ve seen that in the US, but to me it’s not conclusive yet.”\n\nChasing compelling risk-adjusted returns\n\nBetashares’ first offering from the private capital division opens up compelling opportunities for those comfortable with risks associated with an inherently illiquid asset class, founder and chief executive officer Alex Vynokur said.\n\n“For nearly 15 years, we have been focused on delivering high-quality investment opportunities that offer compelling risk-adjusted return profiles as part of a diversified portfolio.\n\n“In service of this mission, our new US private credit exposure, delivered in partnership with Cliffwater, demonstrates our intent to selectively partner with best-in-class private asset managers to deliver institutional-grade investment solutions to eligible Australian investors and their financial advisers,” Vynokur said.\n\nVynokur added that Cliffwater’s multi-lender strategy offers a strong track record.\n\n“We’re proud to be partnering with a high-quality asset manager to unlock a diversified pathway into US private credit for Australian investors.”\n\nThe underlying Cliffwater Corporate Lending Fund Platform currently holds exposure to more than 3,800 individual loans across sectors including healthcare, industrials, IT and financials.\n\nIts portfolio largely consists of senior secured, floating-rate loans to established US businesses, with the platform delivering a net annualised return of 9.63 per cent in US dollars since inception in June 2019, as at 30 June 2025.\n\nBetashares noted that Cliffwater’s multi-lender structure supports diversification and risk management compared to single-manager or single-sector strategies.\n\nVynokur said the initiative is intended to responsibly expand investor access.\n\n“By enabling responsible access to a high-quality private credit exposure, investors and their financial advisers have the opportunity to earn compelling risk adjusted returns.\n\n“Over time, we’re looking forward to building on our private assets offering to offer more institutional grade investment solutions in areas where Australian investors have been traditionally underserved.”\n\nThe launch marks a milestone for Betashares, which has sought to broaden its suite of investment opportunities.",

Payments would continue until 2038 and are capped at around $ 250 million annually.\n\n\n\n“In the case of Sri Lanka, the one-time adjustment nature of the macro-linked bonds presents risks to Sri Lanka as higher payments after 2028, once triggered, would persist even if economic performance were to deteriorate thereafter,” the IMF said in September 2025 working paper titled ‘Sri Lanka’s Sovereign\n\n\n\nDebt Restructuring: Lessons from Complex Processes’.\n\nThe extra payments depend on GDP outcomes between 2025 and 2027.\n\n\n\n“Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 are triggered if dollar GDP in 2025–27 exceeds $ 107 billion, $ 99 billion and $ 94 billion, and 2024–27 cumulative real growth exceeds 11.5%,” the report explained.\n\n\n\nOnce these thresholds are met, higher payments become permanent for a decade regardless of what happens to growth later.\n\n\n\nThe IMF noted that State-contingent debt treatments helped address concerns about macroeconomic uncertainties, but designing them prudently was important.\n\n\n\nThese instruments, known as State-Contingent Debt Instruments (SCDIs), link a country’s payments to its economic performance.\n\n\n\nThey have been used in Argentina, Greece and Ukraine to bridge differences between debtors and creditors by allowing creditors to trade lower upfront recovery for potential higher future payments.\n\n\n\nIn Sri Lanka, however, SCDIs constituted a core part of creditors’ recovery and prolonged the negotiations due to their complexity.\n\n\n\n“They can introduce political complications in the future in case higher payments are triggered but are not socially accepted” the Staff Report said.\n\n\n\nWhile the Fund does not get involved in the details of the instruments’ design in specific cases (this is an issue for the authorities, their creditors, and respective legal and financial advisers), the Fund needs to assess the impact of these instruments on program goals, i.e., the restoration of macroeconomic and debt sustainability,” it added.\n\n\n\nThe IMF does not design these instruments itself but stressed it must evaluate their impact on debt sustainability.\n\n\n\nThis includes assessing whether the extra payments make it more likely that debt targets are breached, whether different groups of creditors are treated fairly, and whether design risks such as uncapped exposures or poorly chosen triggers could undermine repayment capacity.\n\n\n\nThe Fund explained that these assessments involve “complex modelling under the SRDSF framework, which informs the extent to which upside risks can be shared with creditors without compromising debt sustainability.”\n\n\n\nThe SRDSF, or Sovereign Risk and Debt Sustainability Framework, uses fan charts based on past economic data to simulate thousands of possible outcomes for debt and financing needs.\n\n\n\nThe IMF then tests whether adding the SCDIs would increase the probability of crossing debt safety thresholds, worsen debt in bad economic scenarios, or create excessive risks in extreme cases.\n\n\n\nAccording to the IMF, Sri Lanka’s arrangement met these conditions. The probability of breaching debt-to-GDP and gross financing needs targets was within acceptable limits.\n\n\n\nIn scenarios where financing needs were already too high, the SCDIs did not make them worse compared to standard bonds.\n\n\n\nThe report also noted that “the 90th percentile contributions to average GFNs were below 0.4% of GDP,” meaning even in the most adverse 10% of outcomes, the additional burden was still relatively small. Payments were also capped at $ 250 million per year.\n\n\n\nEven so, the Fund cautioned that “some risks remain as no methodology can perfectly capture such complex uncertainties.”",

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG\n\n[SINGAPORE] Intensifying protests in Indonesia and the latest leadership upheaval in Thailand are ratcheting up political risk in the two largest emerging markets in South-east Asia.\n\nIndonesia’s equity benchmark slid 1.5 per cent on Friday (Aug 29), the biggest decline in the world among national gauges tracked by Bloomberg, while its central bank signalled it was stabilising the rupiah. Thailand’s 1.1 per cent equity market retreat on the same day also placed it among the most notable laggards, while the baht slipped.\n\nPresident Prabowo Subianto cancelled a trip to China following the deadly unrest over rising living costs and inequality, as demonstrators targeted the homes of Indonesia’s finance minister and several lawmakers. In Thailand, politicians are jockeying to lead the next government after the disqualification of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra.\n\nThe headwinds flared up just as lower valuations and potential interest-rate cuts raised the prospect of a rotation to South-east Asia by some global funds.\n\n‘Risk premium’\n\nIndonesia’s “political risk will rise, and so will the equity risk premium”, said John Foo, founder of Valverde Investment Partners in Singapore. “We are underweight on Indonesia as the valuations do not reflect the underlying issues in the economy.”\n\nProtests there were sparked by outrage over lawmakers’ housing allowances, nearly 10 times the monthly minimum wage in Jakarta, and fuelled by tax hikes, mass layoffs, and inflation that have disproportionately hit lower-income Indonesians. On Sunday, Prabowo announced that parliament will remove the hefty lawmaker perks.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU Friday, 8.30 am Asean Business Business insights centering on South-east Asia's fast-growing economies. Sign Up Sign Up\n\nThailand has struggled for decades to overcome political infighting, contributing to slower economic growth compared with regional rivals. Anutin Charnvirakul, a conservative politician, claimed late Friday to have sufficient support from lawmakers to become prime minister, saying the nation must not “come to a standstill”.\n\nValverde’s Foo was comparatively sanguine about Thailand, citing cheap valuations and the hope that a new prime minister will stimulate the economy. “The market is ready for a change in PM in Thailand,” he said.\n\nFor Wee Khoon Chong, a senior strategist with BNY in Hong Kong, the baht is likely to remain in its current trading range despite the rising political uncertainty, thanks in part to the downtrend in the US dollar.\n\nIndonesia’s stock market attracted a net US$676 million from foreign investors in August, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In contrast, they pulled US$670 million out of Thailand. So far this year, Thai stocks have dropped about 10 per cent while the Indonesian equity market is up roughly 11 per cent, achieving a record high before the unrest erupted.\n\nOn the currency front, the Indonesian rupiah is one of the weaker performers in Asia this year, down over 2 per cent against the greenback, while the Thai baht has strengthened more than 5 per cent.\n\nLong-term outlook\n\nNirgunan Tiruchelvam, an analyst at Aletheia Capital in Singapore, argued the current turbulence in both nations does not “alter the long-term outlook” given the prospect of looser monetary policy and the valuations the bourses offer.\n\nPrabowo has prioritised economic expansion and pursued a populist agenda since coming to power last year, including a massive free meals programme, raising some concerns about Indonesia’s fiscal outlook. Another signature initiative is a newly established sovereign wealth fund, Danantara, which oversees nearly 900 state firms and has reported US$1 trillion in assets under management.\n\nThe president’s policies have yet to alleviate the economic struggles faced by the lower-income population in Indonesia, said Xin-Yao Ng, an investment director at Aberdeen Investments.\n\n“I have remained concerned about the economic trajectory and am waiting to see what Danantara can achieve in this regard,” Ng said.

Shipena described the transition as an exciting step into a role that aligns perfectly with his academic background and passion for financial markets.Before joining GIPF, Shipena worked as an assistant portfolio manager intern at Capricorn Asset Management.A typical workday for Shipena involves reviewing market trends, analysing economic data and assessing investment opportunities across different asset classes. He prepares reports and presentations to support decision-making and frequently engages in discussions with colleagues in the treasury division about strategy and risk management. His position requires a balance between analytical work and collaboration.Shipena attributes his success to a disciplined, research-driven mindset.While his academic training has instilled a strong foundation in financial analysis, he believes his commitment to adding value through aligning investment decisions with broader goals, such as Namibianisation of the financial services industry, sets him apart. This purpose-driven approach keeps him focused and impactful.Conducive work environmentReflecting on his achievements, Shipena highlighted completing both his undergraduate and honours degrees in finance, which laid the foundation for his career. Progressing through the CFA programme to Level 3 stands out as another milestone. He also expressed pride in quickly integrating into the Treasury division and contributing to discussions and analysis that influence decision-making.Shipena further explained that the first 30 working days came with challenges, including a steep learning curve, familiarising himself with internal systems and adapting to the fund’s investment philosophy and pace of decision-making.However, he credits the collaborative culture, open discussions with colleagues and access to resources and mentorship for helping him perform at his best.Shipena also believes his position allows for a healthy work-life balance, despite the fast-paced and intellectually demanding environment.

            "full_text": "The exchange-traded fund (ETF) provider on Monday launched the Betashares Private Capital Cliffwater Private Credit Fund, the first of its kind in Betashares’ newly established private capital division.\n\nThe unlisted fund aims to provide wholesale investors and financial advisers with cost-effective access to a diversified portfolio of senior loans to predominantly US middle-market companies via a fund managed by private markets manager Cliffwater LLC.\n\nAccording to Betashares, the underlying strategy has delivered attractive risk-adjusted returns with a strong degree of capital stability across different market conditions.\n\nUpon launching its private capital arm, Betashares flagged its push into the asset class was a key part of a long-term strategy of building a diversified financial services business. Betashares is building a range of initiatives – including Betashares Direct, superannuation and now Private Assets – beyond its range of ETFs.\n\nIndustry figures have previously cautioned that attempts to package private credit into ETFs risk distorting an illiquid asset class and undermining investor outcomes.\n\nNamely, at the Australian Wealth Management Summit in Sydney last month, Stéphane Blanchoz, BNP Paribas Asset Management’s head of alternative solutions, said: “We have to be careful when we talk about ETFs because we’re turning something illiquid into something liquid, and off we go.\n\n“I’ve seen many initiatives to have a private credit ETF, and we’ve seen that in the US, but to me it’s not conclusive yet.”\n\nChasing compelling risk-adjusted returns\n\nBetashares’ first offering from the private capital division opens up compelling opportunities for those comfortable with risks associated with an inherently illiquid asset class, founder and chief executive officer Alex Vynokur said.\n\n“For nearly 15 years, we have been focused on delivering high-quality investment opportunities that offer compelling risk-adjusted return profiles as part of a diversified portfolio.\n\n“In service of this mission, our new US private credit exposure, delivered in partnership with Cliffwater, demonstrates our intent to selectively partner with best-in-class private asset managers to deliver institutional-grade investment solutions to eligible Australian investors and their financial advisers,” Vynokur said.\n\nVynokur added that Cliffwater’s multi-lender strategy offers a strong track record.\n\n“We’re proud to be partnering with a high-quality asset manager to unlock a diversified pathway into US private credit for Australian investors.”\n\nThe underlying Cliffwater Corporate Lending Fund Platform currently holds exposure to more than 3,800 individual loans across sectors including healthcare, industrials, IT and financials.\n\nIts portfolio largely consists of senior secured, floating-rate loans to established US businesses, with the platform delivering a net annualised return of 9.63 per cent in US dollars since inception in June 2019, as at 30 June 2025.\n\nBetashares noted that Cliffwater’s multi-lender structure supports diversification and risk management compared to single-manager or single-sector strategies.\n\nVynokur said the initiative is intended to responsibly expand investor access.\n\n“By enabling responsible access to a high-quality private credit exposure, investors and their financial advisers have the opportunity to earn compelling risk adjusted returns.\n\n“Over time, we’re looking forward to building on our private assets offering to offer more institutional grade investment solutions in areas where Australian investors have been traditionally underserved.”\n\nThe launch marks a milestone for Betashares, which has sought to broaden its suite of investment opportunities.",

Standard & Poor’s (S&P) has raised the country's sovereign credit rating by one notch from ‘B+’ to ‘BB-’ Fidelity Bank chief executive said this was far from the end game but “merely a step towards the achievement we are targeting” – a return to investment grade status with all the rating agencies .",
            "full_text": "By NEIL HARTNELL\n\nTribune Business Editor\n\nnhartnell@tribunemedia.net\n\nThe Bahamas is being urged not to let its upgraded credit rating from Standard & Poor’s “go to your head” even as a prominent businessman hailed the move as “a game changer” and signal the economy has “turned the corner”.\n\nGowon Bowe, Fidelity Bank (Bahamas) chief executive, speaking after Standard & Poor’s (S&P) raised the country’s sovereign credit rating by one notch from ‘B+’ to ‘BB-‘ on the basis of it strengthened economy, told Tribune Business that this was far from the end game but “merely a step towards the achievement we are targeting” – a return to investment grade status with all the rating agencies.\n\nThe Bahamas still remains three notches away from escaping so-called ‘junk’ status with S&P, and Mr Bowe said this nation must remain disciplined, “continue those actions” that sparked this upgrade and “accelerate” the improvements if it is to achieve Prime Minister Philip Davis KC’s ambitions of restoring ‘investment grade’ status by 2028-2029.\n\nHowever, Sir Franklyn Wilson, the Arawak Homes and Sunshine Holdings chairman, described S&P’s assessment of The Bahamas’ improved creditworthiness as “a game changer” and signal that this nation is “bouncing back” from the $1.335bn fiscal deficit it incurred for 2020-2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic’s peak.\n\nAsserting that he was “not being partisan”, he argued that the then-Minnis administration had expanded the fiscal deficit at “too rapid” a pace even though significant public spending was necessary after the Bahamian economy was forced to shutdown almost overnight by the pandemic.\n\nSir Franklyn said the S&P upgrade is a sign of improved investor and international capital markets confidence that The Bahamas is emerging from those struggles, and agreed that the country’s enhanced creditworthiness will improve the Government’s access to financing and ability to borrow at lower costs (reduced interest rates) and better terms.\n\nCredit rating upgrades typically give investors greater confidence that countries are managing their fiscal affairs prudently, which can help attract greater levels of foreign direct investment, while lower borrowing costs help ease the debt servicing burden for Bahamian taxpayers.\n\nS&P, explaining what drove The Bahamas’ credit rating upgrade, cited the upward revision to The Bahamas’ gross domestic product (GDP) growth for 2024 by the Bahamas National Statistical Institute (BNSI) to 3.4 percent as well as its strong tourism arrivals performance – especially in the cruise industry.\n\nProviding a further boost by forecasting that Bahamian economic output or GDP growth for 2025 will beat both earlier predictions and its long-run average by coming in at 2.1 percent, S&P said the Government’s energy reforms will be critical to lowering costs for households and companies, improving the ease of doing business and introducing more reliable power supply.\n\n“The Bahamas' GDP grew at a stronger pace of 3.4 percent in 2024, following revised GDP data collection methods from the Bahamas National Statistical Institute, including wider geographic coverage across the Family Islands,” S&P said.\n\n“Further, The Bahamas' tourism sector continued to perform very well, particularly within the cruise segment. Total arrivals in 2024 were 11.2m, compared with 9.6 m the year before and up about 153 percent from 2019. The economy also had support from sustained investments across the Family Islands.\n\n“We expect growth in 2025 will remain above potential at 2.1 percent, accounting for continued buoyancy in tourism despite challenges in key source markets. GDP per capita is estimated at $39,590,” S&P added. “The number of inbound arrivals reached 6.3m in the first half of 2025, compared with 5.7m during the same period in 2024.\n\n“The Bahamas is advancing on its comprehensive energy reforms announced in June 2024, with key partnerships and contracts signed set to support improvements to the country's transmission and distribution infrastructure, as well as diversifying energy sources in favour of solar power and natural gas. These shifts could create important savings and ease the high costs of doing business in the Bahamas over the long-term.”\n\nMr Bowe told Tribune Business that S&P’s action was “absolutely positive news”. He added: “It’s one of moving us up one notch closer to ‘investment grade’. As with all rating assessments, it’s more important to read through the basis for which they made their decision.\n\n“Ultimately, there’s a significant amount of reliance based on the fiscal projections; maybe not a surplus but a reduction in the fiscal deficit and curtailment of expenditure. If we achieve a surplus that’s a bonus. It isn’t one that we must achieve a surplus, but if we get closer to that in the eight to ten months that will bode well and support the upgrade that has taken place.”\n\nMr Bowe acknowledged that energy reform is “high on the agenda” for S&P “from the perspective they are looking to see this isn’t lip service; we are going to see the investments you [the Government] are speaking about and see a reduction in energy costs and improved reliability. That’s a high priority”.\n\nThe Fidelity Bank (Bahamas) chief added that another key focus for S&P, as well as its fellow rating agencies, Moody’s and Fitch, is whether the Government will hit its much-touted 25 percent revenue-to-GDP target as well as wider tax reforms.\n\nExamining the overall impact from S&P’s rating upgrade, which is the first that The Bahamas has enjoyed for almost two decades, Mr Bowe added: “To me, I say let us not get too high on the highs or too low on the lows.\n\n“This one is certainly a positive move. It puts us in non-investment grade with lower risk, and places us in a positive light.” The Bahamas also appears to be tracking Jamaica, albeit one notch behind, with S&P having also raised its fellow Caribbean nation’s credit rating last week.\n\nMr Bowe said Jamaica was more advanced than The Bahamas from the standpoint of having already achieved a Budget surplus and lowered its debt-to-GDP ratio to under 60 percent. This nation’s debt-to-GDP ratio remains in the 70-80 percent range.\n\n“The reason why it’s important to get debt-to-GDP down is because it gives us headroom for hurricanes, it gives us headroom to look at capital development and advancement, it gives us some headroom for future borrowing and asset utilization,” Mr Bowe added.\n\n“It’s important to remain disciplined. There shouldn’t be exaggeration of the upgrade. It’s not taking us from non-investment grade to investment grade. There’s still three notches to go to investment grade.\n\n“It means read the tea leaves for the basis of why they’ve given this assessment, so we manage and ensure these things are carried out and executed so that we can look forward to further upgrades in the ensuing years.”\n\nMr Bowe continued: “In the Bahamian vernacular, the best way to put it is: ‘Don’t let it go your head’. This is not the achievement we want. It’s merely a step to achievement of your target. Don’t get enamoured by a one-notch improvement from non-investment grade to non-investment grade.\n\n“We must continue these positive actions and make sure where possible to accelerate them.” He added that the information upon which S&P based its decision will be available to all other rating agencies as well as multilateral institutions such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which should aid consistency in their assessment of The Bahamas and, potentially, further creditworthiness upgrades.\n\nSir Franklyn, meanwhile, said of S&P’s actions: “It’s a game changer, it’s a game changer. I have just got back from Washington DC, and what is becoming clearer and clearer to me.. I was speaking to some people and what happened to The Bahamas was, and I’m not being partisan here, but what happened here is that the pace at which the Minnis administration increased the national deficit was the problem.\n\n“It happened too quickly. COVID happened, and we have to understand the effects, but the pace of it was too rapid. It was too rapid. I was speaking to a finance man who knows The Bahamas extremely well, and his point was that confidence is building that we are bouncing back from that; that particular period.\n\n“When Minnis ran the deficit up at the pace he did it was too fast. That was too fast. It was too fast. That was the problem. I think it takes time for people to see that we are over that. That’s what I think international agencies are now gaining confidence in. We are over that,” Sir Franklyn added.\n\n“I think this [the S&P upgrade] is really a comment on the fact we have turned the corner from that rapid pace of escalation under Minnis.” Tribune Business calculations show that some $2.896bn was added to The Bahamas’ national debt over the three-year period between 2019-2020 and 2021-2022.\n\nThe Government incurred annual fiscal deficits ranging from $839m during the first of those three fiscal years to $1.335bn in the second and $722m in the latter. However, all were in response to unexpected events – first, the loss, damage and rebuilding caused by Hurricane Dorian and, second, the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Payments would continue until 2038 and are capped at around $ 250 million annually.\n\n\n\n“In the case of Sri Lanka, the one-time adjustment nature of the macro-linked bonds presents risks to Sri Lanka as higher payments after 2028, once triggered, would persist even if economic performance were to deteriorate thereafter,” the IMF said in September 2025 working paper titled ‘Sri Lanka’s Sovereign\n\n\n\nDebt Restructuring: Lessons from Complex Processes’.\n\nThe extra payments depend on GDP outcomes between 2025 and 2027.\n\n\n\n“Scenarios 1, 2, and 3 are triggered if dollar GDP in 2025–27 exceeds $ 107 billion, $ 99 billion and $ 94 billion, and 2024–27 cumulative real growth exceeds 11.5%,” the report explained.\n\n\n\nOnce these thresholds are met, higher payments become permanent for a decade regardless of what happens to growth later.\n\n\n\nThe IMF noted that State-contingent debt treatments helped address concerns about macroeconomic uncertainties, but designing them prudently was important.\n\n\n\nThese instruments, known as State-Contingent Debt Instruments (SCDIs), link a country’s payments to its economic performance.\n\n\n\nThey have been used in Argentina, Greece and Ukraine to bridge differences between debtors and creditors by allowing creditors to trade lower upfront recovery for potential higher future payments.\n\n\n\nIn Sri Lanka, however, SCDIs constituted a core part of creditors’ recovery and prolonged the negotiations due to their complexity.\n\n\n\n“They can introduce political complications in the future in case higher payments are triggered but are not socially accepted” the Staff Report said.\n\n\n\nWhile the Fund does not get involved in the details of the instruments’ design in specific cases (this is an issue for the authorities, their creditors, and respective legal and financial advisers), the Fund needs to assess the impact of these instruments on program goals, i.e., the restoration of macroeconomic and debt sustainability,” it added.\n\n\n\nThe IMF does not design these instruments itself but stressed it must evaluate their impact on debt sustainability.\n\n\n\nThis includes assessing whether the extra payments make it more likely that debt targets are breached, whether different groups of creditors are treated fairly, and whether design risks such as uncapped exposures or poorly chosen triggers could undermine repayment capacity.\n\n\n\nThe Fund explained that these assessments involve “complex modelling under the SRDSF framework, which informs the extent to which upside risks can be shared with creditors without compromising debt sustainability.”\n\n\n\nThe SRDSF, or Sovereign Risk and Debt Sustainability Framework, uses fan charts based on past economic data to simulate thousands of possible outcomes for debt and financing needs.\n\n\n\nThe IMF then tests whether adding the SCDIs would increase the probability of crossing debt safety thresholds, worsen debt in bad economic scenarios, or create excessive risks in extreme cases.\n\n\n\nAccording to the IMF, Sri Lanka’s arrangement met these conditions. The probability of breaching debt-to-GDP and gross financing needs targets was within acceptable limits.\n\n\n\nIn scenarios where financing needs were already too high, the SCDIs did not make them worse compared to standard bonds.\n\n\n\nThe report also noted that “the 90th percentile contributions to average GFNs were below 0.4% of GDP,” meaning even in the most adverse 10% of outcomes, the additional burden was still relatively small. Payments were also capped at $ 250 million per year.\n\n\n\nEven so, the Fund cautioned that “some risks remain as no methodology can perfectly capture such complex uncertainties.”",

            "full_text": "Commodities nearing super cycle\n\nListen to this article\n\nCommodities have had a rough decade, but a confluence of structural factors suggests that after years of underinvestment, the stage may be set for the next super cycle.\n\nCommodities super cycles are long, powerful waves driven by major thematic shifts. The 1970s super cycle saw a mix of geopolitical supply shocks and loose monetary policy. The early 2000s super cycle was defined by China's historic urbanisation boom.\n\nToday, there are structural factors on both the supply and demand sides of the commodities equation that could catalyse the next boom.\n\nTo begin, the supply outlook for commodities overall has a few points of vulnerability that, if tested, could support a bullish long-term outlook.\n\nFirst, critical resources and the capacity to process them are highly concentrated in just a few jurisdictions.\n\nFor instance, S&P Global reports that over 40% of the world's copper production comes from Chile and Peru. Over 50% of the world's iron ore is supplied by Australia and Brazil. And Kazakhstan alone accounts for over 40% of global uranium mine supply.\n\nThis concentration extends beyond extraction to refining. China refines nearly 90% of the world's rare earth elements, which are vital for everything from electric vehicles to defence systems. It also refines over 40% of the world's copper, critical for AI and electrification.\n\nWe have already seen examples of countries using their control of commodities supply as geopolitical leverage. China temporarily restricted rare earth exports in 2025 during trade disputes, and the US included long-term Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) purchase commitments in its tariff agreements with the European Union and South Korea.\n\nThis trend of weaving energy security and dependency into trade discussions and other geopolitical disputes creates a persistent risk premium that could erupt into severe supply disruptions down the line.\n\nCompounding this is a simple geological reality: the easy, high-grade deposits have likely already been found. Greenfield mining projects can now expect to face declining ore grades, soaring capital costs, and lead times that could exceed a decade.\n\nYears of underinvestment, partly due to shareholder pressure on miners to prioritise dividends over growth, have starved the pipeline of future supply.\n\nPowerful secular trends are also unfolding on the demand side that could be quite bullish for commodity prices over the long run.\n\nThe global push for electrification and decarbonisation is profoundly metal-intensive. Copper is the perfect example. While traditional sectors like construction remain important consumers of the base metal, explosive growth looks set to come from electric vehicles, renewable power systems and the vast grid infrastructure needed to support them.\n\nMeanwhile, massive, cash-rich technology companies are investing hundreds of billions of dollars annually in capital expenditures to build out artificial intelligence data centres and related power projects.\n\nFor these firms, securing the necessary energy and materials to win the Al race is an existential imperative, making their demand resilient.\n\nCopper is once again a case in point. The International Energy Agency (IEA) calls the metal a \"global critical mineral\" and estimates that demand based on stated policies and supply from announced projects could lead to a potential shortfall in the sector of 30% by 2035.\n\nThis doesn't look like the story of a cyclical shortage, but a structural collision between an inadequate supply base and accelerating demand.\n\nThe inflation-adjusted copper price remains 30% below its 2011 peak, while the inflation-adjusted oil price and the overall Bloomberg Commodities Index are 70% below their previous peaks in 2008.\n\nAt the same time, investors may need to find a new asset class to reduce portfolio volatility. That's because inflation is proving sticky in several developed markets -- most notably the US -- which could limit central banks' ability to cut rates aggressively when economies weaken and need immediate supportive measures.\n\nThat means the investors can no longer count on bonds to hedge downside risks to equity prices, leaving traditional balanced portfolios consisting only of equities and bonds vulnerable when investors suddenly seek to shed risk.\n\nMany in the investment communities have taken the poor price performance of commodities over the recent decade to be indicative of the future trajectory.\n\nThis backward-looking mentality could potentially stem the flow of capital into this area.\n\nCrucially, once a super cycle starts, it takes a lot to put an end to it. This often requires either painful policy measures on the demand side or major technological breakthroughs on the supply side.\n\nThink former Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker's rate hikes in the 1980s, the US shale revolution in the 2010s, and China's property market downturn more recently. That means these cycles can last for a long time.\n\nWhile properly timing such booms is very challenging, one can note when the underlying conditions for a super cycle appear to be falling into place -- and we could be seeing that now.

Consumers' assessment of business conditions was much less positive than in recent months, while their appraisal of current job availability fell for the ninth straight month to reach a new multiyear low. This is consistent with the decline in job openings.”She added; “Expectations also weakened in September, but to a lesser extent. Consumers were a bit more pessimistic about future job availability and future business conditions but optimism about future income increased.\"Markets were wary over the threat of a US government shutdown, especially given the risk of a negative economic impact.There are also concerns that the shutdown would trigger disruption to economic data with the potential for Friday’s scheduled labour-market data to be postponed.Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets commented; “For markets, this means trading in the near term without one of the most important indicators of U.S. economic health.\"Credit Agricole added; “A potential government shutdown could delay some key data releases and may further have a non-negligible negative impact on the US economy and markets.”As far as the Euro-Zone is concerned, the headline German inflation rate increased to 2.4% for September from 2.2% previously and above consensus forecasts of 2.3%.Credit Agricole commented; “We expect the Governing Council members to reiterate that the outlook for both Eurozone inflation and the ECB policy outlook is balanced.”\n\nInternational Money Transfer?

            "full_text": "Tony Coleman discusses the rise of gold and what this could mean for New Zealanders.\n\nGold is experiencing a significant surge, and experts suggest this is more than a fleeting trend. Global economic shifts and increasing uncertainty around traditional currencies are driving investors towards this asset, as gold has historically been seen as a store of value, though gold prices can fluctuate significantly in the short term. This shift then points to changes in the world’s financial landscape and the attitudes of investors.\n\nA combination of macroeconomic and political factors is fuelling gold’s upward momentum. Rising inflation risks, interest rate uncertainty, and global trade tariffs are all contributing to increased demand. According to a recent report from asset management firm Sprott, these dynamics have created a case for gold. One of the less-discussed drivers is a potential shift in the global financial balance of power. For decades, the US dollar has dominated international finance. However, faith in G7 currencies is showing signs of wear. “While we have central banks bulking their gold reserves, confidence in the US dollar collapsing amid their inflation woes and tension in the Middle East, you’ll see more investors fortifying their portfolios with gold,” says Tony Coleman, Managing Director at New Zealand Gold Merchants.\n\nLocal experts believe that a steady, incremental approach is the most effective way to build a holding in precious metals.\n\nOne of the less-discussed drivers is a potential shift in the global financial balance of power. For decades, the US dollar has dominated international finance. However, faith in G7 currencies is showing signs of wear. “While we have central banks bulking their gold reserves, confidence in the US dollar collapsing amid their inflation woes and tension in the Middle East, you’ll see more investors fortifying their portfolios with gold,” says Tony Coleman, Managing Director at New Zealand Gold Merchants.\n\nThis erosion of confidence is happening alongside the growing influence of economic blocs like BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and newer members). This coalition, which represents a significant portion of the world’s population, is exploring alternatives to the US dollar-based system. Some analysts suggest this could lead to a new financial framework, possibly backed by gold, further diminishing the dominance of traditional fiat currencies.\n\n“Gold is not an investment but stored wealth,” Coleman explains. “It is the ultimate money as it has no leverage, unlike fiat currencies and that means it does not get inflated away. That makes it a highly stable means of storing wealth.” This unique quality makes gold an effective hedge against the currency debasement that can result from massive government spending and quantitative easing.\n\nAs financial commentator Peter Schiff noted for King World News, the real reasons for gold’s rise are often misunderstood. He argues that factors like rising unemployment, swelling federal deficits, and a weakening dollar are setting the stage for persistent sticky inflation, making gold an essential component of any wealth protection strategy.\n\nSo, what does this global trend mean for New Zealanders? It presents an opportunity to diversify investment portfolios in a climate of currency volatility. For many, the idea of buying gold can seem intimidating or reserved for the ultra-wealthy. Local experts believe that a steady, incremental approach is the most effective way to build a holding in precious metals.\n\nFor those looking to begin their precious metals journey, services like GoldSaver offer a straightforward path.\n\n“New Zealanders hold over $200 billion in term deposits. With inflation and currency pressures, the real return can often be close to zero. Some investors choose to hold around 10% in gold as a way to diversify their portfolios.” says Coleman.\n\n“Smart money purchases frequently in regular intervals, rather than dropping a large lump sum in a single transaction,” says Coleman. This strategy, known as dollar-cost averaging, allows an investor to smooth out price fluctuations over time and build a position without trying to “time the market”.\n\nTo make this strategy accessible, New Zealand Gold Merchants (NZGM), a family-run company with roots going back to 1975, has introduced a savings tool called GoldSaver. This platform allows Kiwis to start accumulating physical gold with regular contributions from as little as $50 per month. Investors can set up weekly, fortnightly, or monthly purchases, making ownership attainable for a wide range of people.\n\nThe GoldSaver accounts are pooled, giving participants a share of physical gold bullion securely stored in NZGM’s vaults. The platform provides full transparency, allowing account holders to track their holdings and transaction history online. When they decide the time is right, they can sell gold back to NZGM for cash or convert their savings into physical bars or coins. The service has no management fees, with storage and insurance costs covered by NZGM.\n\nFor those looking to begin their precious metals journey, services like GoldSaver offer a straightforward path.\n\nTo find out more, visit GoldSaver.\n\nNote: GoldSaver is a regular savings plan that allows customers to purchase and store physical gold. It is not a managed investment scheme\n\nDisclaimer: Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance. Returns may go up or down and are not guaranteed.",

Many of us are used to having publicly traded securities, including stocks and bonds, priced by markets .

            "full_text": "Let’s talk about the pricing of assets. People want to know how much their “stuff” is worth — especially when it comes to investments.\n\nMany of us are used to having publicly traded securities, including stocks and bonds, priced daily by markets.\n\nOil, gold and other commodities, REITS and even crypto prices are set by global markets.\n\nOf course, real estate and other illiquid assets are not priced that way, with values only estimated until an actual sale takes place.\n\nBut you might be surprised to learn private market assets — including private equity, private credit and hedge funds — are like real estate and other illiquid assets with only estimated values. “A nickel ain’t worth a dime anymore.” YOGI Berra\n\nThe pitch for private market assets is that illiquidity can actually benefit investors. It allows managers to hold assets longer without worrying about selling at inopportune times, and it can generate higher returns than publicly traded securities.\n\nMany private market funds have a five-, seven- or even 10-year holding period, after which the plan is to sell the underlying holdings.\n\nSome of this actually makes sense, as long as you truly don’t need the money back for the long holding period.\n\nPrivate markets have been widely used as a part of portfolios by big institutional investors (pension funds, endowments, universities) for a couple of decades.\n\nHigh net worth individuals and family offices (“accredited investors”) have also had access to private market products.\n\nInstitutional investors have historically looked for excess returns on private equity of 3% over publicly traded stocks. And like with most investments, results have been mixed, with some notable big wins and some not-so-great results.\n\nBut with its never-ending appetite for sales, Wall Street is now trying to pitch private market products to retail investors.\n\nAnd the more than $12 trillion in defined contribution retirement plans — think 401(k)s, etc. — plus another $16 trillion in IRAs, private product promoters see a massive new sales opportunity.\n\nThe recent pitch has been to “democratize” markets and give the little guy the same access to private market products the big guys have had. Sounds fair, right?\n\nWell, many professionals who serve clients as fiduciaries don’t agree. These folks provide advice on a fee-only basis — and don’t have the potential conflicts-of-interest that come with selling products.\n\nThere are several real concerns about offering private market products to retail investors.\n\nLack of Liquidity\n\nIt can be easy to say you’re OK with tying up your money for five, seven or 10 years when you make an investment, but life has an amazing way of throwing surprises.\n\nWhat if you really needed your money but were told you couldn’t get to it for several more years?\n\nLack of Transparency\n\nMany of these private market products are complicated, making it difficult for even experienced investors to fully understand what they’re buying.\n\nHow many of you have actually read the prospectus for the mutual funds you own, let alone private offering documents for private funds?\n\nHigh Fees\n\nFees on mutual funds and exchange-traded funds have been falling for years, and many publicly traded products have fees of just a small fraction of 1%. Wall Street and fund managers have found they can charge much higher fees for private market products, often 1%-2% PLUS a percentage of profits. No wonder they’re eyeing IRAs and 401(k)s.\n\nSize Matters\n\nMost of the best private market products carry extremely high investment minimums — often $25 million for top-tier funds.\n\nThese products have strict eligibility requirements, available only to “qualified” and “accredited” investors. For many, you can only get access through institutional bankers and consultants.\n\nFiduciaries (and you) should worry about what kinds of offerings you’ll have available in small amounts I’m reminded of Groucho Marx’s joke, “I don’t want to belong to any club that would accept me as a member.”\n\nOne need only imagine the products available small amounts.\n\nThese are all legitimate concerns, but to me there is perhaps the bigger issue of pricing. Since they are not traded daily (or even for several years), private market product valuations are not set by an efficient market.\n\nThere are several core “valuation methods” including the use of comparables (like in real estate), using recent transactions (new investor purchases), discounted cash flows, or asset-based valuations (for funds with substantial tangible assets).\n\nValues may — and likely should — include an “illiquidity discount.” But at the end of the day, the fund manager sets the value, and its true value will only be determined if/when underlying assets are actually sold.\n\nMaybe Yogi Berra will be right, that a nickel really isn’t worth a dime anymore.\n\nI recently attended a meeting with managers of a foundation that handles funds for a nonprofit organization on whose board I serve.\n\nThe foundation works with an advisory firm that consults with more than 250 institutional clients holding $2 trillion in total.\n\nManaging this kind of money gives clients access to top-tier private market products, and advice to go with them.\n\nI was very impressed with these professionals and was not surprised at their response to my question about the “democratization” of private market products.\n\nThey quickly responded with expectations of lawsuits against 401(k) plan sponsors and advisers who as fiduciaries are required to look out for the best interests of clients, noting the same concerns I’ve presented in this column.\n\nSo, I leave you with the words “Caveat Emptor,” that’s “buyer beware” for those of us who didn’t study Latin.",

            "full_text": "StablecoinX Raises $890 Million to Build Massive Ethena Token Treasury\n\nA major financial deal just shook the cryptocurrency world. StablecoinX and TLGY Acquisition Corp. secured $890 million in total funding to create the largest treasury focused on Ethena's ENA tokens. This marks one of the biggest investments in the stablecoin sector this year.\n\nThe companies raised an additional $530 million through a private investment deal, bringing their total commitments to $890 million. Once merged, the new company will hold over 3 billion ENA tokens and become the first dedicated treasury business for the Ethena ecosystem.\n\nRecord-Breaking Deal Structure\n\nThe latest $530 million came from a private investment in public equity (PIPE) transaction. These deals let public companies raise money by selling discounted shares to big investors. The shares sold for $10 each.\n\nTop investment firms joined the funding round. New backers include YZi Labs, Brevan Howard, Susquehanna Crypto, and IMC Trading. Returning investors brought back Dragonfly, ParaFi Capital, Maven11, Kingsway, Mirana, and Haun Ventures.\n\nTLGY, a special purpose acquisition company, will merge with StablecoinX Assets Inc. The combined company will be called StablecoinX Inc. and plans to list on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbol “USDE.” The deal should close by late 2025.\n\nSource: @stablecoin_x\n\nThe Ethena Foundation added even more support with a $310 million token buyback program. This brings total purchases to $570 million, showing strong commitment from the ecosystem’s leadership.\n\nEthena’s Explosive Growth\n\nEthena’s USDe stablecoin has broken multiple records. The token became the fastest stablecoin ever to reach $10 billion in supply, hitting $12.6 billion by September 2025. This happened in under 10 months – much faster than Tether’s USDT (88 months) or Circle’s USDC (38 months).\n\nThe protocol now ranks as the third-largest stablecoin globally, trailing only USDT and USDC. USDe commands over 4% of the entire stablecoin market.\n\nEthena Labs has generated impressive revenue. The protocol crossed $500 million in total earnings, with $13.4 million earned just last week. The USDe supply hit an all-time high of $11.7 billion.\n\nThe growth comes from USDe’s unique design. Unlike traditional stablecoins backed by cash, USDe uses a delta-neutral hedging strategy with staked Ethereum as collateral. This approach lets holders earn yields while maintaining price stability.\n\nStrong Institutional Interest\n\nBig investors are flocking to Ethena’s ecosystem. The active USDe community grew to over 757,000 users across 24 different blockchain platforms by August 2025. The stablecoin’s supply jumped by $2.73 billion, outpacing major competitors.\n\nCrypto billionaire Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, has highlighted ENA as having significant upside potential. Market analysts believe the stablecoin sector could expand dramatically as traditional stablecoin issuers face new yield restrictions under recent regulations.\n\nCurrent USDe holders can earn yields through the protocol’s staking mechanism. These returns come from Ethereum staking rewards and funding rate arbitrage in derivatives markets. Yields fluctuate based on market conditions.\n\nThe platform has formed key partnerships with major DeFi protocols like Aave and Pendle. These integrations help USDe offer competitive yields while expanding its reach across the decentralized finance ecosystem.\n\nRegulatory Compliance and Innovation\n\nEthena is building for long-term success through regulatory compliance. The team developed USDtb, a version that follows the new US GENIUS Act signed by President Trump in July 2025.\n\nThe company partnered with Anchorage Digital, the only federally chartered crypto bank in the United States. This relationship strengthens USDe’s credibility with regulators and institutional investors.\n\nEthena’s 2025 roadmap includes exciting new features. The team plans to launch a Telegram payments app, Apple Pay integration, and innovative stablecoin products. They will also introduce iUSDe in February, built on their existing synthetic dollar technology.\n\nStablecoinX formed a strategic advisory board led by Rob Hadick from Dragonfly. The board will focus on governance, partnerships, and creating long-term value as the company connects traditional equity markets with Ethena’s token economy.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nThis $890 million investment creates the first public company dedicated to the Ethena ecosystem. StablecoinX will provide institutional and retail investors direct access to the growing stablecoin market through a regulated, transparent structure.\n\nThe deal comes as new regulations have banned traditional stablecoin issuers from paying yields, driving demand toward DeFi alternatives like USDe. This regulatory shift could fuel growth for yield-bearing stablecoins.",

            "full_text": "We all know the look of a patient about to crash. The monitor has not flatlined yet, but the story is already in the vitals: The pulse is racing, the pressure is dropping, the skin is clammy.\n\nThat is the U.S. economy right now. Debt overload looks like a chronic hemorrhage. High interest rates are a sustained hypertensive crisis. Political paralysis is the family arguing in the hallway while the patient deteriorates. All we are missing is the shock that tips the system over the edge.\n\nStep 1: Stabilize the bleed\n\nWhen we see a GI bleed, we do not wait until cirrhosis is treated. We stabilize first. For the economy, that means capping runaway spending, stretching out debt maturities, and putting a permanent IV line into the financial system in the form of reliable liquidity support.\n\nStep 2: Fix the underlying disease\n\nThe real disease is structural, and as physicians we live inside its most expensive organ system every day: health care. We know the waste, the price opacity, and the misaligned incentives. Moving to site-neutral payments, demanding real drug and hospital price transparency, and shifting from coding to outcomes would begin to bend the curve. Broader reforms: indexing entitlements, widening the tax base, and allowing more workers into the labor force, are the consultations this complex patient needs.\n\nStep 3: Build resilience\n\nOnce the bleed is controlled and the underlying disease addressed, you build resilience. Long term, the cure is productivity. That means sustained investment in AI, biotech, energy infrastructure, and reskilling our workforce. Think of it as cardiac rehab after the stent, the ongoing work that prevents the next code.\n\nWhat physicians can do now\n\nWe cannot run Treasury or Congress, but we can act as financial first responders in our own lives and practices. That begins with checking our own vital signs, our assets, liabilities, and debt service, on a regular basis. It means having a crash cart ready in the form of a liquid reserve and a credit line. It means adopting a barbell strategy that combines safe cash equivalents with durable, cash-flowing investments, while avoiding fragile balance sheets. And it means running our own code drills: asking ourselves now, not during the chaos, what we would buy, sell, or hold if the market fell thirty percent overnight. Finally, we should educate our teams, from partners to residents, because financial literacy is as critical as clinical literacy.\n\nClosing\n\nWe understand systems in crisis better than anyone. America’s financial patient is not pulseless yet, but it is unstable. When the shock comes, and it will, we need our own crash carts stocked.\n\nWe cannot fix Washington. But we can make sure we are not the ones coding when the system crashes.\n\nLarry Kaskel is an internist and “lipidologist in recovery” who has been practicing medicine for more than thirty-five years.

            "full_text": "Let’s talk about the pricing of assets. People want to know how much their “stuff” is worth — especially when it comes to investments.\n\nMany of us are used to having publicly traded securities, including stocks and bonds, priced daily by markets.\n\nOil, gold and other commodities, REITS and even crypto prices are set by global markets.\n\nOf course, real estate and other illiquid assets are not priced that way, with values only estimated until an actual sale takes place.\n\nBut you might be surprised to learn private market assets — including private equity, private credit and hedge funds — are like real estate and other illiquid assets with only estimated values. “A nickel ain’t worth a dime anymore.” YOGI Berra\n\nThe pitch for private market assets is that illiquidity can actually benefit investors. It allows managers to hold assets longer without worrying about selling at inopportune times, and it can generate higher returns than publicly traded securities.\n\nMany private market funds have a five-, seven- or even 10-year holding period, after which the plan is to sell the underlying holdings.\n\nSome of this actually makes sense, as long as you truly don’t need the money back for the long holding period.\n\nPrivate markets have been widely used as a part of portfolios by big institutional investors (pension funds, endowments, universities) for a couple of decades.\n\nHigh net worth individuals and family offices (“accredited investors”) have also had access to private market products.\n\nInstitutional investors have historically looked for excess returns on private equity of 3% over publicly traded stocks. And like with most investments, results have been mixed, with some notable big wins and some not-so-great results.\n\nBut with its never-ending appetite for sales, Wall Street is now trying to pitch private market products to retail investors.\n\nAnd the more than $12 trillion in defined contribution retirement plans — think 401(k)s, etc. — plus another $16 trillion in IRAs, private product promoters see a massive new sales opportunity.\n\nThe recent pitch has been to “democratize” markets and give the little guy the same access to private market products the big guys have had. Sounds fair, right?\n\nWell, many professionals who serve clients as fiduciaries don’t agree. These folks provide advice on a fee-only basis — and don’t have the potential conflicts-of-interest that come with selling products.\n\nThere are several real concerns about offering private market products to retail investors.\n\nLack of Liquidity\n\nIt can be easy to say you’re OK with tying up your money for five, seven or 10 years when you make an investment, but life has an amazing way of throwing surprises.\n\nWhat if you really needed your money but were told you couldn’t get to it for several more years?\n\nLack of Transparency\n\nMany of these private market products are complicated, making it difficult for even experienced investors to fully understand what they’re buying.\n\nHow many of you have actually read the prospectus for the mutual funds you own, let alone private offering documents for private funds?\n\nHigh Fees\n\nFees on mutual funds and exchange-traded funds have been falling for years, and many publicly traded products have fees of just a small fraction of 1%. Wall Street and fund managers have found they can charge much higher fees for private market products, often 1%-2% PLUS a percentage of profits. No wonder they’re eyeing IRAs and 401(k)s.\n\nSize Matters\n\nMost of the best private market products carry extremely high investment minimums — often $25 million for top-tier funds.\n\nThese products have strict eligibility requirements, available only to “qualified” and “accredited” investors. For many, you can only get access through institutional bankers and consultants.\n\nFiduciaries (and you) should worry about what kinds of offerings you’ll have available in small amounts I’m reminded of Groucho Marx’s joke, “I don’t want to belong to any club that would accept me as a member.”\n\nOne need only imagine the products available small amounts.\n\nThese are all legitimate concerns, but to me there is perhaps the bigger issue of pricing. Since they are not traded daily (or even for several years), private market product valuations are not set by an efficient market.\n\nThere are several core “valuation methods” including the use of comparables (like in real estate), using recent transactions (new investor purchases), discounted cash flows, or asset-based valuations (for funds with substantial tangible assets).\n\nValues may — and likely should — include an “illiquidity discount.” But at the end of the day, the fund manager sets the value, and its true value will only be determined if/when underlying assets are actually sold.\n\nMaybe Yogi Berra will be right, that a nickel really isn’t worth a dime anymore.\n\nI recently attended a meeting with managers of a foundation that handles funds for a nonprofit organization on whose board I serve.\n\nThe foundation works with an advisory firm that consults with more than 250 institutional clients holding $2 trillion in total.\n\nManaging this kind of money gives clients access to top-tier private market products, and advice to go with them.\n\nI was very impressed with these professionals and was not surprised at their response to my question about the “democratization” of private market products.\n\nThey quickly responded with expectations of lawsuits against 401(k) plan sponsors and advisers who as fiduciaries are required to look out for the best interests of clients, noting the same concerns I’ve presented in this column.\n\nSo, I leave you with the words “Caveat Emptor,” that’s “buyer beware” for those of us who didn’t study Latin.",

            "full_text": "Tony Coleman discusses the rise of gold and what this could mean for New Zealanders.\n\nGold is experiencing a significant surge, and experts suggest this is more than a fleeting trend. Global economic shifts and increasing uncertainty around traditional currencies are driving investors towards this asset, as gold has historically been seen as a store of value, though gold prices can fluctuate significantly in the short term. This shift then points to changes in the world’s financial landscape and the attitudes of investors.\n\nA combination of macroeconomic and political factors is fuelling gold’s upward momentum. Rising inflation risks, interest rate uncertainty, and global trade tariffs are all contributing to increased demand. According to a recent report from asset management firm Sprott, these dynamics have created a case for gold. One of the less-discussed drivers is a potential shift in the global financial balance of power. For decades, the US dollar has dominated international finance. However, faith in G7 currencies is showing signs of wear. “While we have central banks bulking their gold reserves, confidence in the US dollar collapsing amid their inflation woes and tension in the Middle East, you’ll see more investors fortifying their portfolios with gold,” says Tony Coleman, Managing Director at New Zealand Gold Merchants.\n\nLocal experts believe that a steady, incremental approach is the most effective way to build a holding in precious metals.\n\nOne of the less-discussed drivers is a potential shift in the global financial balance of power. For decades, the US dollar has dominated international finance. However, faith in G7 currencies is showing signs of wear. “While we have central banks bulking their gold reserves, confidence in the US dollar collapsing amid their inflation woes and tension in the Middle East, you’ll see more investors fortifying their portfolios with gold,” says Tony Coleman, Managing Director at New Zealand Gold Merchants.\n\nThis erosion of confidence is happening alongside the growing influence of economic blocs like BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, and newer members). This coalition, which represents a significant portion of the world’s population, is exploring alternatives to the US dollar-based system. Some analysts suggest this could lead to a new financial framework, possibly backed by gold, further diminishing the dominance of traditional fiat currencies.\n\n“Gold is not an investment but stored wealth,” Coleman explains. “It is the ultimate money as it has no leverage, unlike fiat currencies and that means it does not get inflated away. That makes it a highly stable means of storing wealth.” This unique quality makes gold an effective hedge against the currency debasement that can result from massive government spending and quantitative easing.\n\nAs financial commentator Peter Schiff noted for King World News, the real reasons for gold’s rise are often misunderstood. He argues that factors like rising unemployment, swelling federal deficits, and a weakening dollar are setting the stage for persistent sticky inflation, making gold an essential component of any wealth protection strategy.\n\nSo, what does this global trend mean for New Zealanders? It presents an opportunity to diversify investment portfolios in a climate of currency volatility. For many, the idea of buying gold can seem intimidating or reserved for the ultra-wealthy. Local experts believe that a steady, incremental approach is the most effective way to build a holding in precious metals.\n\nFor those looking to begin their precious metals journey, services like GoldSaver offer a straightforward path.\n\n“New Zealanders hold over $200 billion in term deposits. With inflation and currency pressures, the real return can often be close to zero. Some investors choose to hold around 10% in gold as a way to diversify their portfolios.” says Coleman.\n\n“Smart money purchases frequently in regular intervals, rather than dropping a large lump sum in a single transaction,” says Coleman. This strategy, known as dollar-cost averaging, allows an investor to smooth out price fluctuations over time and build a position without trying to “time the market”.\n\nTo make this strategy accessible, New Zealand Gold Merchants (NZGM), a family-run company with roots going back to 1975, has introduced a savings tool called GoldSaver. This platform allows Kiwis to start accumulating physical gold with regular contributions from as little as $50 per month. Investors can set up weekly, fortnightly, or monthly purchases, making ownership attainable for a wide range of people.\n\nThe GoldSaver accounts are pooled, giving participants a share of physical gold bullion securely stored in NZGM’s vaults. The platform provides full transparency, allowing account holders to track their holdings and transaction history online. When they decide the time is right, they can sell gold back to NZGM for cash or convert their savings into physical bars or coins. The service has no management fees, with storage and insurance costs covered by NZGM.\n\nFor those looking to begin their precious metals journey, services like GoldSaver offer a straightforward path.\n\nTo find out more, visit GoldSaver.\n\nNote: GoldSaver is a regular savings plan that allows customers to purchase and store physical gold. It is not a managed investment scheme\n\nDisclaimer: Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future performance. Returns may go up or down and are not guaranteed.",

            "full_text": "Commodities nearing super cycle\n\nListen to this article\n\nCommodities have had a rough decade, but a confluence of structural factors suggests that after years of underinvestment, the stage may be set for the next super cycle.\n\nCommodities super cycles are long, powerful waves driven by major thematic shifts. The 1970s super cycle saw a mix of geopolitical supply shocks and loose monetary policy. The early 2000s super cycle was defined by China's historic urbanisation boom.\n\nToday, there are structural factors on both the supply and demand sides of the commodities equation that could catalyse the next boom.\n\nTo begin, the supply outlook for commodities overall has a few points of vulnerability that, if tested, could support a bullish long-term outlook.\n\nFirst, critical resources and the capacity to process them are highly concentrated in just a few jurisdictions.\n\nFor instance, S&P Global reports that over 40% of the world's copper production comes from Chile and Peru. Over 50% of the world's iron ore is supplied by Australia and Brazil. And Kazakhstan alone accounts for over 40% of global uranium mine supply.\n\nThis concentration extends beyond extraction to refining. China refines nearly 90% of the world's rare earth elements, which are vital for everything from electric vehicles to defence systems. It also refines over 40% of the world's copper, critical for AI and electrification.\n\nWe have already seen examples of countries using their control of commodities supply as geopolitical leverage. China temporarily restricted rare earth exports in 2025 during trade disputes, and the US included long-term Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) purchase commitments in its tariff agreements with the European Union and South Korea.\n\nThis trend of weaving energy security and dependency into trade discussions and other geopolitical disputes creates a persistent risk premium that could erupt into severe supply disruptions down the line.\n\nCompounding this is a simple geological reality: the easy, high-grade deposits have likely already been found. Greenfield mining projects can now expect to face declining ore grades, soaring capital costs, and lead times that could exceed a decade.\n\nYears of underinvestment, partly due to shareholder pressure on miners to prioritise dividends over growth, have starved the pipeline of future supply.\n\nPowerful secular trends are also unfolding on the demand side that could be quite bullish for commodity prices over the long run.\n\nThe global push for electrification and decarbonisation is profoundly metal-intensive. Copper is the perfect example. While traditional sectors like construction remain important consumers of the base metal, explosive growth looks set to come from electric vehicles, renewable power systems and the vast grid infrastructure needed to support them.\n\nMeanwhile, massive, cash-rich technology companies are investing hundreds of billions of dollars annually in capital expenditures to build out artificial intelligence data centres and related power projects.\n\nFor these firms, securing the necessary energy and materials to win the Al race is an existential imperative, making their demand resilient.\n\nCopper is once again a case in point. The International Energy Agency (IEA) calls the metal a \"global critical mineral\" and estimates that demand based on stated policies and supply from announced projects could lead to a potential shortfall in the sector of 30% by 2035.\n\nThis doesn't look like the story of a cyclical shortage, but a structural collision between an inadequate supply base and accelerating demand.\n\nThe inflation-adjusted copper price remains 30% below its 2011 peak, while the inflation-adjusted oil price and the overall Bloomberg Commodities Index are 70% below their previous peaks in 2008.\n\nAt the same time, investors may need to find a new asset class to reduce portfolio volatility. That's because inflation is proving sticky in several developed markets -- most notably the US -- which could limit central banks' ability to cut rates aggressively when economies weaken and need immediate supportive measures.\n\nThat means the investors can no longer count on bonds to hedge downside risks to equity prices, leaving traditional balanced portfolios consisting only of equities and bonds vulnerable when investors suddenly seek to shed risk.\n\nMany in the investment communities have taken the poor price performance of commodities over the recent decade to be indicative of the future trajectory.\n\nThis backward-looking mentality could potentially stem the flow of capital into this area.\n\nCrucially, once a super cycle starts, it takes a lot to put an end to it. This often requires either painful policy measures on the demand side or major technological breakthroughs on the supply side.\n\nThink former Federal Reserve Chair Paul Volcker's rate hikes in the 1980s, the US shale revolution in the 2010s, and China's property market downturn more recently. That means these cycles can last for a long time.\n\nWhile properly timing such booms is very challenging, one can note when the underlying conditions for a super cycle appear to be falling into place -- and we could be seeing that now.

PHOTO: BLOOMBERG\n\n[SINGAPORE] Intensifying protests in Indonesia and the latest leadership upheaval in Thailand are ratcheting up political risk in the two largest emerging markets in South-east Asia.\n\nIndonesia’s equity benchmark slid 1.5 per cent on Friday (Aug 29), the biggest decline in the world among national gauges tracked by Bloomberg, while its central bank signalled it was stabilising the rupiah. Thailand’s 1.1 per cent equity market retreat on the same day also placed it among the most notable laggards, while the baht slipped.\n\nPresident Prabowo Subianto cancelled a trip to China following the deadly unrest over rising living costs and inequality, as demonstrators targeted the homes of Indonesia’s finance minister and several lawmakers. In Thailand, politicians are jockeying to lead the next government after the disqualification of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra.\n\nThe headwinds flared up just as lower valuations and potential interest-rate cuts raised the prospect of a rotation to South-east Asia by some global funds.\n\n‘Risk premium’\n\nIndonesia’s “political risk will rise, and so will the equity risk premium”, said John Foo, founder of Valverde Investment Partners in Singapore. “We are underweight on Indonesia as the valuations do not reflect the underlying issues in the economy.”\n\nProtests there were sparked by outrage over lawmakers’ housing allowances, nearly 10 times the monthly minimum wage in Jakarta, and fuelled by tax hikes, mass layoffs, and inflation that have disproportionately hit lower-income Indonesians. On Sunday, Prabowo announced that parliament will remove the hefty lawmaker perks.\n\nA NEWSLETTER FOR YOU Friday, 8.30 am Asean Business Business insights centering on South-east Asia's fast-growing economies. Sign Up Sign Up\n\nThailand has struggled for decades to overcome political infighting, contributing to slower economic growth compared with regional rivals. Anutin Charnvirakul, a conservative politician, claimed late Friday to have sufficient support from lawmakers to become prime minister, saying the nation must not “come to a standstill”.\n\nValverde’s Foo was comparatively sanguine about Thailand, citing cheap valuations and the hope that a new prime minister will stimulate the economy. “The market is ready for a change in PM in Thailand,” he said.\n\nFor Wee Khoon Chong, a senior strategist with BNY in Hong Kong, the baht is likely to remain in its current trading range despite the rising political uncertainty, thanks in part to the downtrend in the US dollar.\n\nIndonesia’s stock market attracted a net US$676 million from foreign investors in August, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. In contrast, they pulled US$670 million out of Thailand. So far this year, Thai stocks have dropped about 10 per cent while the Indonesian equity market is up roughly 11 per cent, achieving a record high before the unrest erupted.\n\nOn the currency front, the Indonesian rupiah is one of the weaker performers in Asia this year, down over 2 per cent against the greenback, while the Thai baht has strengthened more than 5 per cent.\n\nLong-term outlook\n\nNirgunan Tiruchelvam, an analyst at Aletheia Capital in Singapore, argued the current turbulence in both nations does not “alter the long-term outlook” given the prospect of looser monetary policy and the valuations the bourses offer.\n\nPrabowo has prioritised economic expansion and pursued a populist agenda since coming to power last year, including a massive free meals programme, raising some concerns about Indonesia’s fiscal outlook. Another signature initiative is a newly established sovereign wealth fund, Danantara, which oversees nearly 900 state firms and has reported US$1 trillion in assets under management.\n\nThe president’s policies have yet to alleviate the economic struggles faced by the lower-income population in Indonesia, said Xin-Yao Ng, an investment director at Aberdeen Investments.\n\n“I have remained concerned about the economic trajectory and am waiting to see what Danantara can achieve in this regard,” Ng said.

            "full_text": "StablecoinX Raises $890 Million to Build Massive Ethena Token Treasury\n\nA major financial deal just shook the cryptocurrency world. StablecoinX and TLGY Acquisition Corp. secured $890 million in total funding to create the largest treasury focused on Ethena's ENA tokens. This marks one of the biggest investments in the stablecoin sector this year.\n\nThe companies raised an additional $530 million through a private investment deal, bringing their total commitments to $890 million. Once merged, the new company will hold over 3 billion ENA tokens and become the first dedicated treasury business for the Ethena ecosystem.\n\nRecord-Breaking Deal Structure\n\nThe latest $530 million came from a private investment in public equity (PIPE) transaction. These deals let public companies raise money by selling discounted shares to big investors. The shares sold for $10 each.\n\nTop investment firms joined the funding round. New backers include YZi Labs, Brevan Howard, Susquehanna Crypto, and IMC Trading. Returning investors brought back Dragonfly, ParaFi Capital, Maven11, Kingsway, Mirana, and Haun Ventures.\n\nTLGY, a special purpose acquisition company, will merge with StablecoinX Assets Inc. The combined company will be called StablecoinX Inc. and plans to list on the Nasdaq stock exchange under the ticker symbol “USDE.” The deal should close by late 2025.\n\nSource: @stablecoin_x\n\nThe Ethena Foundation added even more support with a $310 million token buyback program. This brings total purchases to $570 million, showing strong commitment from the ecosystem’s leadership.\n\nEthena’s Explosive Growth\n\nEthena’s USDe stablecoin has broken multiple records. The token became the fastest stablecoin ever to reach $10 billion in supply, hitting $12.6 billion by September 2025. This happened in under 10 months – much faster than Tether’s USDT (88 months) or Circle’s USDC (38 months).\n\nThe protocol now ranks as the third-largest stablecoin globally, trailing only USDT and USDC. USDe commands over 4% of the entire stablecoin market.\n\nEthena Labs has generated impressive revenue. The protocol crossed $500 million in total earnings, with $13.4 million earned just last week. The USDe supply hit an all-time high of $11.7 billion.\n\nThe growth comes from USDe’s unique design. Unlike traditional stablecoins backed by cash, USDe uses a delta-neutral hedging strategy with staked Ethereum as collateral. This approach lets holders earn yields while maintaining price stability.\n\nStrong Institutional Interest\n\nBig investors are flocking to Ethena’s ecosystem. The active USDe community grew to over 757,000 users across 24 different blockchain platforms by August 2025. The stablecoin’s supply jumped by $2.73 billion, outpacing major competitors.\n\nCrypto billionaire Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, has highlighted ENA as having significant upside potential. Market analysts believe the stablecoin sector could expand dramatically as traditional stablecoin issuers face new yield restrictions under recent regulations.\n\nCurrent USDe holders can earn yields through the protocol’s staking mechanism. These returns come from Ethereum staking rewards and funding rate arbitrage in derivatives markets. Yields fluctuate based on market conditions.\n\nThe platform has formed key partnerships with major DeFi protocols like Aave and Pendle. These integrations help USDe offer competitive yields while expanding its reach across the decentralized finance ecosystem.\n\nRegulatory Compliance and Innovation\n\nEthena is building for long-term success through regulatory compliance. The team developed USDtb, a version that follows the new US GENIUS Act signed by President Trump in July 2025.\n\nThe company partnered with Anchorage Digital, the only federally chartered crypto bank in the United States. This relationship strengthens USDe’s credibility with regulators and institutional investors.\n\nEthena’s 2025 roadmap includes exciting new features. The team plans to launch a Telegram payments app, Apple Pay integration, and innovative stablecoin products. They will also introduce iUSDe in February, built on their existing synthetic dollar technology.\n\nStablecoinX formed a strategic advisory board led by Rob Hadick from Dragonfly. The board will focus on governance, partnerships, and creating long-term value as the company connects traditional equity markets with Ethena’s token economy.\n\nThe Road Ahead\n\nThis $890 million investment creates the first public company dedicated to the Ethena ecosystem. StablecoinX will provide institutional and retail investors direct access to the growing stablecoin market through a regulated, transparent structure.\n\nThe deal comes as new regulations have banned traditional stablecoin issuers from paying yields, driving demand toward DeFi alternatives like USDe. This regulatory shift could fuel growth for yield-bearing stablecoins.",

            "full_text": "First held in November 2021, the Belize Investment Summit was created to attract and promote investment for economic development in Belize. The summit is a high-profile event led by the Office of the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Finance, Investment, and Economic Development. Organised every two years, the 2025 edition, held from September 3 to 5, was themed Bridging Markets, Building Resilience. It concluded as a resounding success, attracting over 600 prominent international investors, business leaders, government officials, and local entrepreneurs. Preliminary estimates indicate investment commitments exceeding BZ$1.5 billion across various sectors.\n\nThe summit facilitated hundreds of one-on-one meetings between project proponents and investors. A landmark Memorandum of Understanding for Belize’s first-ever sugar refinery was signed on-site, and a presentation highlighted the Master Plan for the Port of Belize Cruise and Cargo Project.\n\nOrganisers said the successful event solidified Belize’s position as a premier strategic and sustainable regional investment destination. Prime Minister Hon. Dr. John Briceño highlighted the growth of the summit since its first edition. “We are very pleased with the response,” Briceño said. “People come for many reasons. The wealth of information that they get from networking with different partners, both private and public sector, the ability to even meet ministers and officials within government, to talk about a project.”\n\nBriceño added that he held numerous meetings throughout the event. “Because of that personalised touch, we believe that it has been very successful,” he said. He noted that the government has seen hundreds of millions of dollars invested over the past four years following previous summits.\n\n“The resounding success of the summit far exceeded our expectations,” the prime minister continued. “We did not just talk about potential; we showcased tangible, bankable projects. The overwhelming response from the global investment community is a powerful testament to their confidence in Belize’s political stability, economic reforms, and our unwavering commitment to sustainable and inclusive growth.” Briceño emphasised that the summit represented not only investment opportunities but also investments in the future of the Belizean people.\n\nMinister of Tourism Hon. Anthony Mahler reaffirmed that Belize is open for business. “We are looking at investors from all over the world,” he said. “We need more investments in the country and the tourism industry. Different sectors within the industry must be built up to ensure that we continue sustaining growth in the future.”\n\nHosted at the Sunset Caribe Resort north of San Pedro Town, Ambergris Caye, the three-day summit was a dynamic platform to showcase high-impact investment opportunities across Belize’s key growth sectors. Areas explored included sustainable tourism and hospitality, agro-processing, renewable energy, digital innovation and FinTech, infrastructure, logistics, aviation, and the burgeoning blue economy, among other emerging sectors.\n\nOther highlights included in-depth sectoral presentations, which provided detailed breakdowns of investment opportunities supported by robust data and clear regulatory frameworks. Project pitch sessions allowed local entrepreneurs and developers to present innovative and scalable business models to a global audience. Policy reform dialogues offered candid conversations between the public and private sectors, addressing investor questions and outlining the government’s agenda to improve business efficiency.\n\nSustainability was a central focus of all discussions, with every session underscored by the principle of responsible development prioritising environmental conservation and community benefits. “The energy and professionalism at this summit were exceptional,” said one investor, Chief Executive Officer of an international company. Others noted that Belize has uniquely positioned itself at the intersection of profitability and purpose. Observers praised the government’s clarity of vision and the quality of opportunities, describing Belize as a serious and compelling player on the global investment stage.\n\nThe Belize Investment Summit 2025 was organized by the Government of Belize through the Office of the Prime Minister and the Belize Trade and Investment Development Service (BELTRAIDE), in partnership with the Inter-American Development Bank. Other development partners, international financial institutions, and the private sector supported the event.\n\nThe summit’s secretariat announced that planning for the Belize Investment Summit 2027 is underway, building on the tremendous momentum generated this year.",

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources , and more. Learn More\n\nLets imagine a common portfolio for an Aussie investor.\n\nYou might have exposure to some of the major blue-chip companies listed on the ASX. This could be a variety of the big banks, mining and materials stocks etc.\n\nYou also know that a balanced portfolio includes stocks outside Australia. Based on this, you might have bought a fund that tracks the S&P 500 Index (SP: .INX).\n\nThis gives you exposure to sectors less common on the ASX like technology and healthcare, as well as big global companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nAt this point, your portfolio is looking solid.\n\nNow you may be looking to add a small but concentrated investment in one specific sector.\n\nThis is called thematic investing. Here are some growing themes you may be interested in targeting.\n\nCommodities\n\nCommodities are simply raw materials.\n\nThey can be precious metals like gold and silver or foodstuffs like corn and wheat and even energy resources like crude oil and natural gas.\n\nThis year, physical commodities like gold have far outpaced the returns of the ASX 200. The price of physical gold has risen more than 40%.\n\nThis can be a strong investment for diversification because commodity prices can often move differently from share prices.\n\nGold has a long history of preserving its value, so investors flock to it when other financial markets get rocky.\n\nIf you are interested in adding commodities like gold to your portfolio, some ASX ETFs to consider include:\n\nGlobal X Physical Gold (ASX: GOLD)\n\n(ASX: GOLD) BetaShares Gold Bullion ETF – Currency Hedged (ASX: QAU)\n\n(ASX: QAU) VanEck Gold Miners ETF (ASX: GDX)\n\nArtificial Intelligence\n\nA growing theme that may interest investors is artificial intelligence.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the global AI market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38.1% from 2022 to 2030.\n\nAI stocks can be companies involved in chip making, software, or firms that utilise artificial intelligence in their applications.\n\nImportantly, the ASX does not have as many AI focussed stocks as other markets. This can make AI ASX ETFs beneficial, as investors can gain exposure to innovative AI companies in the US, Asia and Europe.\n\nSome to consider for AI exposure include:\n\nGlobal X AI Infrastructure ETF (ASX: AINF)\n\n(ASX: AINF) Global X Robo Global Robotics And Automation ETF (ASX: ROBO)\n\n(ASX: ROBO) Global X Artificial Intelligence ETF (ASX: GXAI)\n\nESG ASX ETFs\n\nESG stands for environmental, social, and governance. It is a growing theme amongst investors to target not only financial growth, but simultaneously have a positive global impact through their investment choices.\n\nAs the name suggests, this may involve targeting companies committed to contributing to climate targets, supporting human rights etc. It can also involve actively excluding companies that contribute to violence, war, alcohol/tobacco manufacturing or negatively impacting the environment.\n\nIf this sounds like a strategy you would like to include in your investment portfolio, some ASX ETFs to consider include:",

Gold forged above $3,800 an ounce for the first time on Tuesday as investors continued to fret about paper assets . Fed Chair Jerome Powell: \"Near-term risks to inflation are tilted to the upside and risks to employment to the downside\" Nasdaq Composite tumbled 215.50 points, or 0.95 percent, to settle at 22,573.47 .

            "full_text": "NEW YORK, New York - U.S. stocks retreated from record levels on Monday following remarks by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that challenging times lay ahead.\n\n\"Near-term risks to inflation are tilted to the upside and risks to employment to the downside, a challenging situation,\" Powell said Monday. \"Two-sided risks mean that there is no risk-free path,\" he added.\n\nGold forged above $3,800 an ounce for the first time on Tuesday as investors continued to fret about paper assets.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite tumbled 215.50 points, or 0.95 percent, to settle at 22,573.47. The broad-based S&P 500 also fell sharply, declining 36.83 points, or 0.55 percent, to close at 6,656.92. The Dow Jones Industrial Average showed relative resilience but still finished in negative territory, dipping 88.76 points, or 0.19 percent, to 46,292.78.\n\nThe uniform decline across major U.S. indexes suggests a wave of broad-based profit-taking following recent rallies, particularly in the high-flying technology sector. Investors appeared to reassess valuations amid ongoing concerns about future interest rate paths and economic growth.\n\nMarket analysts pointed to a rise in bond yields as a key factor pressuring growth-oriented tech stocks, whose valuations are more sensitive to higher borrowing costs. The retreat indicates a cautious mood prevailing among traders as they await fresh economic data for clearer signals on the health of the economy.\n\nU.S. Dollar Shows Mixed Performance in Tuesday's Trading\n\nThe U.S. dollar traded with a mixed bias against a basket of major currencies on Tuesday, showing strength against commodity-linked currencies but weakening slightly against UK and European majors.\n\nThe euro edged higher, with EUR/USD climbing 0.11 percent to trade at 1.18163. The British pound also gained ground on the greenback, with GBP/USD rising 0.10 percent to 1.35253.\n\nThe dollar found firmer footing against the Japanese yen, with USD/JPY dipping a modest 0.10 percent to 147.56.\n\nIt posted more significant gains against the Canadian dollar, as USD/CAD advanced 0.17 percent to 1.38406. The greenback saw a modest decline against the Swiss franc, with USD/CHF falling 0.13 percent to 0.79131.\n\nIn the commodity currency space, the Australian dollar was nearly flat against the U.S. dollar, with AUD/USD inching up a slight 0.02 percent to 0.6599. Conversely, the New Zealand dollar softened, with NZD/USD declining 0.13 percent to 0.5858.\n\nThe lack of a clear, unified direction suggests a market in a holding pattern, with traders likely awaiting key economic data or central bank commentary for their next significant directional bets. The moves reflect ongoing assessments of global economic growth trajectories and interest rate expectations.\n\nEuropean Indices Lead Global Gains as Asia-Pacific Markets Show Mixed Results, Canada Falls, UK Flat\n\nGlobal equity markets presented a mixed picture on Tuesday, with European bourses posting solid gains while major indices in Asia and the Pacific struggled for direction.\n\nThe selling pressure in the U.S. extended north of the border, with Canada's S&P/TSX Composite index dropping 143.35 points, a loss of 0.48 percent, to end the session at 29,815.63.\n\nThe pan-European EURO STOXX 50 index was a standout performer, climbing 30.34 points, or 0.56 percent, to close at 5,472.39. France's CAC 40 also enjoyed a strong session, advancing 41.91 points, or 0.54 percent, to finish at 7,872.02. Germany's DAX added 84.28 points, a gain of 0.36 percent, settling at 23,611.33.\n\nThe positive sentiment extended to the broader Euronext 100, which rose 0.50 percent to 1,642.80. Belgium's BEL 20 also edged lower, falling 0.17 percent to 4,699.64.\n\nThe UK's FTSE 100 was nearly flat, dipping a marginal 3.66 points, or 0.04 percent, to close at 9,223.32.\n\nIn Asia, trading was more subdued. Japan's Nikkei 225 continued its strong run, jumping 447.85 points, or 0.99 percent, to a new peak of 45,493.66. Taiwan's TWII was the session's top performer, surging 1.42 percent. South Korea's KOSPI and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also finished in positive territory, rising 0.51 percent and 0.40 percent, respectively.\n\nConversely, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index declined 185.02 points, or 0.70 percent, to 26,159.12. Mainland China's SSE Composite Index slipped 0.18 percent to 3,821.83. India's S&P BSE Sensex ended the day essentially unchanged, down a slight 0.07 percent.\n\nOther notable moves included Indonesia's IDX Composite, which rose over 1 percent, and Singapore's STI Index, which eked out a 0.12 percent gain. Markets in New Zealand and Malaysia were virtually unchanged for the day.\n\nThe divergent performances highlight investor caution as they await key economic data and central bank signals later in the week, which are expected to provide clearer direction for global markets.\n\nRelated stories;\n\nMonday 22 September 2025 | Wall Street marks back-to-back record gains | big News Network\n\nFriday 19 September 2025 | Record-breaking day ends jubilant week on Wall Street | Big News Network\n\nThursday 18 September 2025 | Wall Street extends gains, dollar rebounds some more | Big News Network\n\nWednesday 17 September 2025 | Dow Jones jumps 260 points, dollar climbs, after Fed move | Big News Network\n\nTuesday 16 September 2025 | Wall Street retreats from record highs ahead of Fed rate decision | Big News Network\n\nMonday 15 September 2025 | Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 close at record highs Monday | Big News Network",
