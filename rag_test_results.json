      "full_text": "Argentum AI (AAI) has unveiled a new decentralized computing platform aimed at bridging the gap between surging global demand for AI computation and the vast reserves of idle computing capacity around the world. By directly connecting those in need of processing power with those who can supply it, AAI promises to dramatically reduce costs by up to 85% compared to traditional cloud providers while fostering a transparent, community-driven ecosystem for cloud infrastructure.\n\nIn today's cloud computing market, a handful of providers dominate, leading to exorbitant prices, hardware shortages, and underutilized resources. AI startups and researchers often struggle to access affordable high-performance compute, even as many servers and GPUs sit idle in data centers and homes. This mismatch between soaring demand and unused supply has created an inefficient, fractured market where buyers overpay or go without, and hardware owners see expensive machines sit idle. AAI was conceived to solve th...",

More than a decade ago, then prime minister John Key imagined the country as the \"Switzerland of the South Pacific\".\n\nEarlier this year, Luxon described his proposed Invest New Zealand agency as being \"modelled off the success of Ireland and Singapore\", pitched as a \"concierge\" service for large foreign investors.\n\nBut based on my research on how big-tech cloud providers expand and dominate markets across the globe, I argue such comparisons are simplistic and misleading.\n\nUnlike Ireland, New Zealand does not sit at the junction of the European Union and the United States.
